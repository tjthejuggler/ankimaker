This video is a sequel to Rhonda’s popular "micronutrient smoothie" recipe.While Dr. Rhonda Patrick’s first video focused primarily on the micronutrients found in the various fruits and vegetables she put in her smoothie, this one, in addition to offering some modest changes on the recipe, instead focuses on the beneficial “hormetic” compounds that are NOT micronutrients. Some of these compounds include: polyphenols, flavanols, and phytonutrients. She also talks about fermentable fiber and other prebiotics that feed beneficial bacteria in the gut that are present in the vegetables and fruits. Additionally, she explains why she sometimes adds a little hydrolyzed collagen powder to her smoothie and sheds some light on the topic of so-called “anti-nutrients.”
