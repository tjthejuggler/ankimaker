disable 'create_deck' button if youtube video is invalid or no text file is selected
maybe make the youtube invalid message red

make the list of characters to be re.subbed somewhere as a constant variable so we dont need to change it in both places(subtitles is different)

persistent skipped list option
	it is a checkbox in setup
	it keeps an external list of words that have been skipped and skips them automatically
	should be viewable/editable from inside tkinter

make the option to exclude proper nouns(first letter capitalized and not at the begining of a sentence, make sure it doesnt exclude if the whole word is capital)

investigate note in get_translation() in ankilang

maybe split at 'are' in article like we did 'is'
