Dr. Peter Attia is the founder of Attia Medical, a medical practice with offices in San Diego and New York City, focusing on the applied science of longevity and optimal performance. You may have first heard about Dr. Attia from his two interviews that have been on the Tim Ferriss show, or from any number of popular presentations he's given that were filmed and put online. In addition to being a medical doctor, Dr. Attia has done research on the role of regulatory T cells in cancer regression and other immune-based therapies for cancer. Regulatory T cells have also been, in the past, referred to as suppressor T cells because of their role in actually attenuating or reducing the inflammatory response. Dr. Attia and I share interests in all things related to longevity and healthspan, which includes the role of diet, nutrition, sleep, exercise, and stress. Dr. Attia is a medical doctor and specializes in implementing these strategies in clinical practice. You can learn more about that at his website.
