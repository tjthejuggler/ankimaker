add more translation services

clean prints to make them more usefull (put in there which translation services were successful)

maybe exclude names from being translated (detected with caps)

set up a try/catch to tell user if anki isnt installed with autorun

make a progress bar for language deck creation (and maybe article)
	looks like in order to do this we would need to move part of ankilang into ankimaker
		so we can keep updating the progress bar

see if there is a way to make it go faster

see if we can go directly to a particular folder when file browser is opened

in text_type_radiobutton_changed(), maybe the windows check should be for linux as well or something simlar
=======
pip install requirements.txt didn't work for me on windows.

NEEDS SORTED

disable 'create_deck' button if youtube video is invalid or no text file is selected
maybe make the youtube invalid message red
	should maybe make a label next to it that says why its disabled

make the list of characters to be re.subbed somewhere as a constant variable so we dont need to change it in both places(subtitles is different)

persistent skipped list option
	it is a checkbox in setup
	it keeps an external list of words that have been skipped and skips them automatically
	should be viewable/editable from inside tkinter

make the option to exclude proper nouns(first letter capitalized and not at the begining of a sentence, make sure it doesnt exclude if the whole word is capital)

investigate note in get_translation() in ankilang

maybe split at 'are' in article like we did 'is'

redo 2,3,4 or club de cuervos
