GUI
one gui for both anki programs
file select
language/article
threshold inputs
a button that prints all words and shows their frequency to help select frequency thresholds
either a unique deck id input or hook it up to current date/time
for language, have a src and dest language input with dropdown
--
to do this, copy gui code from miug
combine both programs into one folder and make (at least) 3 seperate files each with their own class
	gui
	article
	language

for subtitles, make a tag that 'allEpisodes' and/or 'almostAllEpisodes'

make githubs of either project

anki article
maybe split at 'are'
pay attention in testing that coronaviruses is working properly, it may be weird.






ankiarticle todo

remove word from definition? would be better to just make it editable once the user selects it
remove any /n from definitions

tell output file name when completed

make this definitions into flashcards
make fill in the blanks for the words that are being defined
consider going a second level with the definitions, meaning get the definitions of the rare words in the definitions
	make a function that is get_rare_words(str) - str can be the original article as well as a str of all the definitions gathered
make instructions/rarity variables

ideas
freq threshold could somehow be dynamic by asking the user to y/n words to be used

it presents a word and asks y/n?
	if y, it gets the definition if it can
		if it cannot, it asks you to input definition
	if n, it goes to the next word
once all words have been presented, it asks if definitions should be mined for rare words and defined y/n?
	if y, repeat process
		once all words have been presented, ask if it should go another level(being sure to exclude any repeats)
	if n, use all current keywords to make fill in the blanks from sentences in the article

making fake functions of anything that uses internet will allow for continuing to work with no internet
	this could also be done with a try/except setup that tells the user they need internet



ankisub todo
change folder name of this
quit usiing lower and use uppercases that are not at the begining of a sentence/phrase to indicate that a word is probably  aproper title and should not be translated

add progress bar
organize code better, make things into functions
make decks of more movies
incorporate mediaName into the open file instead of captions
see if there is a library for detecting names
see if there are any alternatives to google translation or find some way to know how well google tranlate worked for a particle running of the program
	maybe a way to make it run better is to occasionally give it a "long" rest if it gets too many dupes in a row or something

redo 2,3,4 or club de cuervos
