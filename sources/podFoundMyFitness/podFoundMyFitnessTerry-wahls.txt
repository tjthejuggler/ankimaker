In this video, Dr. Rhonda Patrick interviews Dr. Terry Wahls about how she reversed her secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis with a micronutrient-dense diet and Paleo principles. She identified vitamins/minerals and other compounds present in vegetables/fruits that are essential for mitochondrial health, which is critical for brain function.




                "The root of the problem begins in the cell, and the root of the cell's health is the micronutrient environment." - Dr. Terry Wahls
