This podcast is about one of the most important biological pathways you could possibly take the time to learn about: the NRF2 pathway.The most potent naturally-occurring inducer of this pathway is a plant compound known as sulforaphane, which many studies suggest may have properties that prove to be therapeutic in many different contexts. No greedy capitalists are conspiring to keep it out of your hands because it's naturally produced in large quantities by none other than the humble... broccoli sprout! There is so much to say when we talk about the NRF2 pathway and isothiocyanates like sulforaphane that we had to pack it into 47 minutes and break it into a few key sections.Key sections:

00:01:14 - Cancer and mortality
00:19:04 - Aging
00:26:30 - Brain and behavior
00:38:06 - Final recap
00:40:27 - Dose
