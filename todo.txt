See if we can run article program on entire pdf books


use packs or grids or whatever on splitters window

an extra window for 'show_frequencies'

make an option to run deck/anki after deck is created
	this can be a checkbox in setup
	maybe use  subprocess.call

bring show_frequencies into tkinter
	use the text widget and give it a 'back' button
	help_clicked also needs to be done like this

TEXT BOX STYLING/CLEANING
in text box, make words being defined green and/or bold or something
	maybe some other color coding would be in order as well
	color coding can probably be done with a function like
	tkprintColor('text', color) and then just make it the same but no /n

when a definition is set, tkprint the word with its definition?
	if we do this then maybe we could get rid of all the definition options out of the text box to make it easier to look through


fix phone/pc size mismatch of choose def entry and text either by using a text as the entry
	or by making a conditional that checks to see what device
	or figure out if there is something like fill that can be used
________

TESTING

find out if word variations is being handled properly

test new splitters system in language

test pdf


___________

HOUSE CLEANING

clean up imports

figure out if we can get rid of globals
	this would take a bit of refactoring, maybe isn't necessary

___________

NEW SETUP FEATURES

make 'fill in the blank' cards a togglable option

input for additional tags
___________

NEEDS SORTED

disable 'create_deck' button if youtube video is invalid or no text file is selected
maybe make the youtube invalid message red
	should maybe make a label next to it that says why its disabled



make the list of characters to be re.subbed somewhere as a constant variable so we dont need to change it in both places(subtitles is different)

persistent skipped list option
	it is a checkbox in setup
	it keeps an external list of words that have been skipped and skips them automatically
	should be viewable/editable from inside tkinter

make the option to exclude proper nouns(first letter capitalized and not at the begining of a sentence, make sure it doesnt exclude if the whole word is capital)

investigate note in get_translation() in ankilang

maybe split at 'are' in article like we did 'is'

redo 2,3,4 or club de cuervos
