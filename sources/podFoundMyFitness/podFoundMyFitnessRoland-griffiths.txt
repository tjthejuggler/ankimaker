Dr. Roland Griffiths is a clinical pharmacologist at Johns Hopkins and one of the world's foremost researchers on the psychedelic compound psilocybin.




                "I've come to think of psilocybin as a convergent methodology for investigation of the nature of mind. [...] It wakes people up to the extent to which the normative way they hold reality is just one way of holding reality." - Dr. Roland R. Griffiths
