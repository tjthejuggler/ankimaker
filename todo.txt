when deck is created it should either close the tkinter or totally reset everything
	right now after article we have to do ctr c

make the list of characters to be re.subbed somewhere as a constant variable so we dont need to change it in both places(subtitles is different)

THESE SHOULD ALL BE REMOVED EVEN WHEN SHOWING FREQ RATINGS
make a 'words that have been skipped' file
make an 'exclude this format' input for things like ch01note34
make the option to exclude proper nouns(first letter capitalized and not at the begining of a sentence, make sure it doesnt exclude if the whole word is cacpital)

#look into quillionz and python library question-generation for making questions

maybe split at 'are' in article like we did 'is'

put try/excepts anywhere that may prevent a big loss of work

make many decks of foundmyfitness podcasts for when on the road
redo 2,3,4 or club de cuervos
