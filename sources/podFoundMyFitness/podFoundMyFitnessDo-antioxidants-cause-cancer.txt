Dr. Rhonda Patrick explains what antioxidants are, why they are important, and how they prevent DNA damage, a well-known cancer initiator.Vitamin E and Prostate CancerHowever, in the context of someone that already has cancer, DNA damage can activate genes that kill cancer cells. Moreover,  taking mega doses (i.e. 400 IU/day) of alpha tocopherol has the unintended side-effect of actually depleting tissue levels of another important form of vitamin E that plays an anti-inflammatory role, known as gamma tocopherol. Tissue depletion of gamma tocopherol may be an especially important missing link that helps explain the correlation between vitamin E supplementation and prostate cancer established in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT).
