TEXT BOX STYLING/CLEANING
in text box, make words being defined green and/or bold or something
	maybe some other color coding would be in order as well
	color coding can probably be done with a function like
	tkprintColor('text', color) and then just make it the same but no /n

when a definition is set, tkprint the word with its definition?
	if we do this then maybe we could get rid of all the definition options out of the text box to make it easier to look through

________

TESTING

find out if word variations is being handled properly

test new splitters system in language

test pdf


___________

HOUSE CLEANING

clean up imports

figure out if we can get rid of globals
	this would take a bit of refactoring, maybe isn't necessary
___________

NEW SETUP FEATURES

make 'fill in the blank' cards a togglable option

input for additional tags
___________

NEEDS SORTED

disable 'create_deck' button if youtube video is invalid or no text file is selected
maybe make the youtube invalid message red
	should maybe make a label next to it that says why its disabled



make the list of characters to be re.subbed somewhere as a constant variable so we dont need to change it in both places(subtitles is different)

persistent skipped list option
	it is a checkbox in setup
	it keeps an external list of words that have been skipped and skips them automatically
	should be viewable/editable from inside tkinter

make the option to exclude proper nouns(first letter capitalized and not at the begining of a sentence, make sure it doesnt exclude if the whole word is capital)

investigate note in get_translation() in ankilang

maybe split at 'are' in article like we did 'is'

redo 2,3,4 or club de cuervos
