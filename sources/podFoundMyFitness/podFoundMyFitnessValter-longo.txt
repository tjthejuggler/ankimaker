Dr. Longo has made huge contributions to the field of aging, including the role of fasting and diet in longevity and healthspan in humans as well as metabolic fasting therapies for the treatment of human diseases.




                "In a mouse, about 40% of the white blood cells are destroyed during this period of four days of fasting or so. And then that 40% is rebuilt within a few days of refeeding." - Dr. Valter Longo
