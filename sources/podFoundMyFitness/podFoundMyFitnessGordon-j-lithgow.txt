Dr. Gordon Lithgow is a professor of gerontology at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. The topic of conversation in this episode is especially focused on Dr. Lithgow's work with C. elegans, which a tiny nematode worm he uses to interrogate questions involving the aging process and lifespan extension.




                "Of course, proteins misfold during heat shock. And, as a result, these defense systems are actually acting against the normal aging process which is also the misfolding of proteins." - Dr. Gordon Lithgow

Discussed in this episode:

The role that protein aggregation plays in the aging process and neurodegenerative diseases
How heat stress activates genetic pathways, including heat shock proteins, in worms and humans that lower protein aggregation and extend lifespan in worms. 
How too much iron can lead to protein aggregation and how vitamin D can prevent it. 
A program, directed by Gordon, called the Caenorhabditis Intervention Testing Program which tests potential longevity compounds that may extend the lifespan of several different species of worms. This serves as a broad, early exploration that may potentially help us to find ways to enhance human longevity as well.
