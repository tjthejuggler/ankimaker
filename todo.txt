we want to be able to put in our own splitters for tags, like 'Book I, Book II' or
	a way to save past splitters would be good as well, a dropdown would be good for this, just save any new way that is used to a text file

input for additional tags

remove 1 and 2 letter words from show freq
	also make everything lower

make the list of characters to be re.subbed somewhere as a constant variable so we dont need to change it in both places(subtitles is different)

THESE SHOULD ALL BE REMOVED EVEN WHEN SHOWING FREQ RATINGS
make a 'words that have been skipped' file
	if we do this then we should show words that will be skipped due to it make optional
make the option to exclude proper nouns(first letter capitalized and not at the begining of a sentence, make sure it doesnt exclude if the whole word is capital)

#look into quillionz and python library question-generation for making questions

maybe split at 'are' in article like we did 'is'

put try/excepts anywhere that may prevent a big loss of work

make many decks of foundmyfitness podcasts for when on the road
redo 2,3,4 or club de cuervos
