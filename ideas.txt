article_card_maker
	it gets the most uncommon(not just uncommon in the article, in normal usage) words and presents them individually to the user

	it makes fill in the blank cards by taking sentences that contain the user chosen words (aaaa_aaaa b)
	this will be especially good for podcast transcripts with heavy vocab
